# EM-SideChannel-Attack-AES128
Electromagnetic side-channel analysis of AES-128 on Raspberry Pi 4 using a bare-metal implementation. Key recovery through trace alignment and statistical analysis.

# üîí Bare-Metal AES-128 Side-Channel Attack on Raspberry Pi 4 (DRDO Internship Project)

This project demonstrates an **electromagnetic (EM) side-channel attack** on a **bare-metal implementation of AES-128** encryption, conducted as part of an internship at **DRDO‚Äôs SAG Lab**. The aim was to show the feasibility of recovering secret encryption keys by analyzing EM radiation emitted from a Raspberry Pi 4 during cryptographic operations.

## üìå Objective

To implement **AES-128 encryption in bare-metal C** on Raspberry Pi 4, collect EM traces during encryption, and apply **statistical side-channel analysis techniques** (specifically **Correlation Power Analysis**, CPA) to extract the secret AES key.
